Slack Hooks for MakeSpace
Reviews started for a PR

- all additional comments a thread inside that?
- At first it can send just a link to each person
- “Comment made by Me in #140”
- Nah each comment needs to be a message - now you have to have each pR a thread so people can talk exclusively about that PR
- But you can “send to channel” on a PRs comment and it will send directly to that thread in GH
